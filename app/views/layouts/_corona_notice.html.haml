  %h2 Changes to Hackney Works Services during Covid-19
  %p The Hackney Works offices are closed - we will keep these web pages updated with job/training information. Our employment advisors are providing telephone support, however, please bear with us â€“ our priority is to support vulnerable clients, those facing a redundancy situation and those interested in volunteering/jobs/careers in key worker roles.
