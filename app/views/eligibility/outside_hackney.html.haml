  %h2.subtitle Do you live within Hackney?

  %p Sorry, based on the post code you provided it looks like you live outside Hackney so we werenâ€™t able to register you online.

  %p You could still be eligible for our service if either of the following apply:
  %ul
    %li You are being housed in Hackney Council temporary accommodation outside the borough.
    %li You have Hackney Council as a corporate parent, i.e. you are or were in care.

  %p
    If so, please call us on
    =link_to "0208 356 5700", "tel:0208 356 5700"
    and we will book you an appointment with an advisor.

  %p If not, try your local council website for information about employment support services in your area.

  %p If you live in Hackney and are seeing this screen either try registering again and make sure your post code is correct, or you can register over the phone by calling the hub closest to where you live:
